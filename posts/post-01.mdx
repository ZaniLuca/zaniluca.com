[Expo](https://expo.dev) is a great tool for building multiplatform apps using the magic of React Native and it's easily one of the faster ways to make a mobile app, especially for web developers.

But how we can make it even faster? Of course with _automation_!

Fortunately, one of the easiest ways to automate your code tasks is provided basically for free by GitHub, and it's called [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

In this guide, we'll learn how to set up a basic **CI/CD** environment to automatize your app builds both with [EAS](https://expo.dev/eas) infrastructure or simply with the containerized environment provided by GitHub Actions.

> This guide will assume a basic understand of how CI/CD works with GitHub Actions but everything needed can be learnd on the [offical docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

Let's start by creating a brand new expo app by running the following command:

```bash
npx create-expo-app expo-cicd-github-actions
```

### test

Then let's install the CLIs we need if we haven't done so already

```bash
npm i -g eas-cli expo-cli
```

In this tutorial, we'll cover every fundamental topic in a good continuous integration and delivery system, so we'll include **Unit Tests**! For this purpose, we'll use **Jest** which offers a great integration for expo apps.

Let's start by installing the packages we'll need

```bash
expo install jest-expo jest
```

In **package.json** let's add the test script and the jest configuration _(this can also be placed in a separate file "jest.config.js")_. Add a new script called `test` inside the scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "test": "jest"
  },
  ...
  "jest": {
    "preset": "jest-expo"
  },
}
```

Then for demo purposes let's write an example test to check that everything is working as expected.

Create a new folder `__tests__` and inside it place a file ending in `.test.js` and add some example test cases like this one for example

```js
it("works", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

Try running `npm run test` and if we did everything right it should succeed!
